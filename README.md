## Features
- **Real-Time Pose Detection**: Utilizes MediaPipe's Pose solution to track body landmarks.
- **Bicep Curl Tracking**: Calculates the angle of the left arm to detect and count bicep curl repetitions.
- **Visual Feedback**: Displays rep count, exercise stage ("up" or "down"), and arm angle on the video feed.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable for other exercises by modifying angle landmarks.
